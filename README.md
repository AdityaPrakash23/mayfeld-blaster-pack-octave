# Mayfeld-Blaster-Pack-octave
This repo contains code for robotics calculations for the Mayfeld's blaster pack project in octave.
Here, the octave scripts will be collected during the process of my robotics study and simultaneous
progression of the Mayfeld's Blaster pack project on Hackaday. The link for the project page is

If anyone comes across this and want to mess around with this, please feel free to do so!
Cheers!
